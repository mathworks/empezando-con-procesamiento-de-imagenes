The Amazon Rainforest is the largest and most diverse rainforest in the world, which makes it important to protect.

Unfortunately, the rainforest has been receding due to heavy deforestation, but recent conservation efforts have slowed that rate.  

See how Image Processing Toolbox is used to analyze and track deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest to see the effects of those conservation efforts.

The deforestation.mlx Live Script processes multiple satellite images of the Jamanxim National Forest taken every 4 years from 2000 to 2016.

Take a look at createMask.m - a function generated through the Color Thresholder App that turns interacting with an app into usable code.

Run the Live Script and observe the results. See if you can tweak various parts of the algorithm to get a better result.

To start, try regenerating createMask.m with a different set of thresholds or using a different color space using the Color Thresholder App.
